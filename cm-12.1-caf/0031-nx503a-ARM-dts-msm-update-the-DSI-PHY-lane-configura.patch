Subject: [PATCH 31/50] nx503a: ARM: dts: msm: update the DSI PHY lane
 configuration settings

cherry-pick from 30ab05acb22ebbf642a47eb3225ad0b6a8cac79f

With the present DSI lane configuration, there is slight delay
observed on data transfer between different data lanes. Update
the DSI PHY lane configuration with the recommended settings from
the h/w team to fix this issue.
