Subject: [PATCH 04/50] nx503a: msm: krait-regulator: handle efuse differences

cherry-pick from 5c50e2f56bf8218ef68cffeb583cc7d8d8bb2ce4

Scaling factor version is valid for
- 8974 based devices when the version bits read 1

Moreover the three bit scaling factor data for
- 8974 based devices starts at bit 16

Update the code to handle these differences.
