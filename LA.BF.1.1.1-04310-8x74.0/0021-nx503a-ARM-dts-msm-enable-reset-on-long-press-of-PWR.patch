Subject: [PATCH 21/36] nx503a: ARM: dts: msm: enable reset on long press of
 PWR key

cherry-pick from b4dbdec21f673894282597f851da61d8520da467

The dt property "qcom,support-reset" is added explicitly in the
KPDPWR child node of PON module. This enables s2 reset as well as
configures the s1 and s2 timers for KPDPWR reset source. Now long
press of PWR key makes the device to go into download mode.
